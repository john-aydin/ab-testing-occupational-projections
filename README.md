**Long-term Occupational Projections in New York**

In this dataset, there are a set of projections over the course of ten years (specifically, from 2018-2028) related to occupational growth based on a compilation of recent employment records. The data is drawn from various markets of labor in several major regions of the state of New York. The collected data is presented in a few different ways, including: 



* Annual (incremental) change in job openings, 
* The base labor and the expected amounts of total change in job openings between the start and end points of this period (represented as a whole number and as a percentage), 
* And a consideration of change that may account for existing (formerly filled) positions becoming reopened during this period.
    * (As opposed to the occupational growth that may be attributed to new job openings being created in the same duration of time.)

It appears as though this dataset may be useful for determining adjustments that address concerns of human resources, general management, and staffing budgetary departments. 

	The research question for this project is the following:

Will two highly specialized fields (in particular, Actuaries and Psychiatrists) grow at a similar rate in an area with a high population density (New York state) over the current and upcoming years (2018 to 2028)?

	The hypotheses that are planned to test are as follows:

**H<sub>0 </sub>**: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the Null</span> - on average, there is no statistically significant difference between the rates at which the job openings for actuaries and psychiatrists will grow.

**H<sub>a </sub>**: <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the Alternative</span> - on average, there is indeed a statistically significant difference between the rates at which the job openings for actuaries and psychiatrists will grow (<span style="text-decoration:underline;">prediction</span>: those for actuaries will grow at a greater rate than those for psychiatrists).

	The hypotheses will be tested using the data source attached by following this procedure:



* Using a t-test and examining the p-value to infer an initial conclusion
* Running a Shapiro-Wilk test to determine whether or not the distribution being studied is akin to a normal distribution (which, in a way, may provide a sense of how consistent the distribution in question is).
* Utilizing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in order to determine whether the two samples being examined have means that are too different to support the act of comparing them.

Stakeholders who will find this research valuable include actuaries and psychiatrists, as well as hiring managers and their teams. Additionally, other groups who may be interested in utilizing the results of this research would include students of mathematically-based and psychologically-based disciplines, as well as individuals aiming to make career changes into these fields.

	The audience will benefit from these research findings by gaining the following:



* An understanding of how efficiently prior organizational programs for staffing and career growth developed and executed.
* A special focus on the growth for actuarial and psychiatric positions.
* An idea of whether or not methods of managing labor markets in New York may benefit from being revamped.

As a result of these parameters and expectations, perhaps this research may serve as a model for comparing assessed growth between careers that share qualities of education and preparation standards with each other.
